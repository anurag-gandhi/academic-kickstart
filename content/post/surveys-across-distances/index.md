COVID-19 has not only restricted travel and social interaction but has also led to an unprecedented break in the research and data collection activities. Projects have come to a halt leaving researchers and data collectors perplexed. In light of this, SurveySights is conducting a survey with the field community in India across multiple states and sectors in both urban and non-urban areas. The two main objectives were:
+ To understand the full range of experiences and impacts on their livelihoods and well-being.

 + To understand COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices.
