Payal has witnessed the power of data to be transformative and empowering for the most vulnerable in society. Having worked in the development sector for ~3 years and through significant research and implementation experience, sheâ€™s developed a profound appreciation for data-driven insights to inform development policy.

Most recently, she has worked with the University of Chicago and led impact evaluations on topics at the intersection of environment and development where she managed field operations and implementation strategy. Her expertise includes blending academic research with the feasibility of on-the-ground programs and specialisation in survey design and evaluation methods.

At SurveySights, her work entails developing best practices to improve data quality and survey workflows, co-lead projects, and co-coordinate client development efforts. She brings in extensive experience with primary data collection, quantitative skills, and community engagement.

She holds a Masters in Economics from Toulouse School of Economics with a concentration in Public Policy and Development. In her spare time, she enjoys photography, listening to podcasts, nerd-ing out about RCTs and AI, and is happy to help with all things DATA.
